## Scheduling Daily Searches

### Option 1: Vercel Cron Jobs (Recommended for Production)

If deploying on Vercel, add to `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/cron",
    "schedule": "0 9 * * *"
  }]
}
```

This runs daily at 9 AM UTC.

### Option 2: External Cron Service

Use services like:
- **Uptime Robot**: Set up HTTP monitor to ping `https://your-domain.com/api/cron`
- **Cron-job.org**: Free cron job service
- **EasyCron**: Simple web-based cron

Configure them to make a GET request to:
```
https://your-domain.com/api/cron
```

With header:
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET
```

### Option 3: GitHub Actions

Create `.github/workflows/daily-search.yml`:

```yaml
name: Daily Search
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  search:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger Daily Search
        run: |
          curl -X GET https://your-domain.com/api/cron \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.CRON_SECRET }}"
```

### Option 4: Local Development (Manual)

Click the "Refresh" button in the dashboard to manually trigger searches.

## Search Topics

The app searches for discussions about:

- Open Video platform mentions
- Creator-owned video platforms
- YouTube alternatives for creators
- Video monetization (100% revenue retention)
